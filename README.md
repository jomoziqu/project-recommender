This Project Utilizes Machine Learning Algorithms.
We implemented Ensemble Learning Technique to increase our accuracy and robustfulness of our model.
 - Ensemble Learning is a technique in ML that strategically generates and combines multiple models e.g classifiers to solve an computational intelligennce problem.
